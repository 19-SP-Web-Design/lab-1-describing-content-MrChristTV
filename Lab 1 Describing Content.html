<h2>
Video Games
</h2>
	<p>
		I am a video gamer by heart I will play any type of video games but my favorite at the moment are battle royale <em>(BR)</em> games.
		The object of a battle royale is to be the last person or last team if you are on a team, standing. 
		The amount of people in each game can range from 60-100 with the games I play. 
		Each of the four I will be explaining later, all have different functions and mobility mechanics that make them different. 
		They are similar in the sense they all are battle royale and shoot to kill opponents.
	</p>

	<h3> 
	Call Of Duty Black Ops 4 
	</h3>
	<p>
		The current titles I play are, Call of Duty Black Ops 4 Blackout mode which is essentially a run and gun first person shooter (FPS). 
		The maximum players allowed in a game in 100 with teams of 4 on each squad. 
		If you ever played their multiplayer than their battle royale shouldn’t feel to foreign to you. 
		The only differences are the amount of health a player has and the fact you can get body armor to further protect you in gunfights.

	<h4>
	Fortnite
	</h4>
	<p>
		Next, Fortnite which is a third person shooter with building aspects of it. 
		When the building aspects were introduced, as expected, people had a troublesome time adjusting to the new mechanics. 
		The way the building worked was you gather material, from three sources, 
		you have wood which was the weakest, then brick which was moderate strength, and finally metal which was the most durable of the three. 
		You can build about as high as you’d like but there was a limit to how many material you could carry and that max was <strong>999</strong> for each material.
	</p>
	<h5> 
	Apex Legends 
	</h5>
	<p>
		After that, the newest installment of the three is Apex Legends I only got to play this a few times, 
		but within that time I can say it’s the fastest pace out of the three and similar to Blacks Ops 4 Blackout mode. 
		The reason this BR is different and fun is because there are different characters and each have different abilities they can access to help them win the game.

	<h1>
	PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
	</h1>
	<p>
	The most fun I had playing a royale is Player Unknowns Battle Ground. 
	This game was the original BR game that I wanted to get my hands on. 
	I could do that because at the time it was only available on the computer. 
	So, when it was time for it to be released on the Xbox One you can imagine my <strong> excitement! </strong>
	This game combines realism and strategy along with skill in aiming down the sights.
